OpenCog's AtomSpace Viewer
-------------------------------

The visualizer for Opencog's atomspace is using Bootstrap, Jquery, D3, Jquery UI compoments in order to connect, display and edit data on the OpenCog's AtomSpace.

The main HTML code where all the elements are being stored is under the file atom_viewer.html. 
All the Javascript code as well as any assets used such as images or CSS code is under the folder Media.

The new visualizer has also a terminal window in order to work faster and more efficient. For a list of commands just type "help" in the terminal window. If the window is not visible you can make it visible from the menu View>Terminal.
